But the main cynosure for this event will be that it’s going to be a completely digitalized game. One of our team members has developed a software program on pHp and node.js for the event. This is our own innovation that will make us stand different from normal quizzes. As you’d have seen in Kaun Banega Crorepati, we’ll have two laptops/screens – one for the contestant and other one for us. The participant will connect to our server through their smartphones and then a ‘Buzzer’ and buttons for four options such as ‘A’,’B’,’C’ and ‘D’ will appear on the screen of the phone. The question will pop up on both the screens of the laptops and options on the phone. The contestant is supposed to hit the correct answer and walk further. The experience will go up as there is going to prize money as the contestant reaches the next level. There’ll be registration fees and winner prizes.
